	name = _ "Ritualist"
	description = "The clerical order was founded generations ago to care for the wounded and dying of ancient wars. But this pastoral work gradually gave way to the study of life and death, and the clerics uncovered the arcane arts which gave them a terrifying power. The order transformed itself into a powerful and secretive society. Most now serve at the discretion of an influential noble, tending to their growing armies and sometimes participating in battle themselves. Clerics have a higher resistance to ‘arcane’ attacks. "
