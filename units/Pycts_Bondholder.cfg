	description= _ "For the woodsmen of the DÃ¡l Ardhoen, the axe signifies their passage into adulthood, and they quickly learn to use it to hew wood, build a home, and settle disputes. A few master the tool in combat, preferring a close scrap with their enemy to the revolving dance of spears and swords. But they know how to throw an axe too, more through drunken competitions than by training, and will call upon this skill when necessary.

Most choose the work of the woods over a warrior's life, but each is bound in word and deed to their clan, and many battles turn on the ferocious rush of axes in action. For this reason, when foreigners tell of the fearsome fighting style of the Pycts, it is often the bondholders they describe. But the Pycts themselves do not consider them to be true warriors."
