    description=_ "The Pycts live over the mountains beyond the Roaen Wood in the lands of Dál Ardhoen. The days are short and dark there in the winter, and the brief summers are stormy and wild. Or so it is told by the few who have journeyed to the far edge of the continent. Dál Ardhoen has been forgotten by the kings of Thaeylan and is mostly ignored by the maurading slavers of the Wood. But it is a snowy idyll for the Pycts, who needn't do much to ward off invaders.

Harvests there are meagre, so the Pycts live off of the plants and animals in the woods and seas around them. For most of the year they settle in small villages, bound together in clans by oath and kin. But in lean years they must migrate to follow the herds and this brings the clans into conflict. The fractious, bloody fueds of the Pycts are quick, treacherous affairs, and their songs are full of the names of clans lost to all but memory.

Indeed, the people of Dál Ardhoen rarely speak of themselves as Pycts at all. They are first and foremost clanfolk, and each clan is its own people. In some, men and women are expected to fight and lead as equals. In others, women are all but chattel. But these differences are set aside each summer, when the clans gather for an annual festival in the west. And no man or woman of any clan would interfere with the sacred burial grounds of Hearthmór. In these matters, and these matters alone, the Pycts remain a common people."
