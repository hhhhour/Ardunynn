    description= _ "An experienced leader from the chief's family is often treated as a chief in all but name. They play a major role in the chief's inner circle and in some cases make up the better part of the influence a chief has over other families in the clan.

When trust is broken between a kin laird and their chief, a struggle for leadership is inevitable. But in most cases the chief is the elder of the two. A kin laird who bides their time may be chief soon enough."
