    description= _ "The young scions of a chief's family are called upon to carry the clan's standard into battle. Poorly equipped and unable to carry a shield, it takes a special bravery to bear this burden, so the sight of a banner aloft in the midst of battle tends to gird the loins of the clan's fighters.

Every Pyctish warrior aspires to fell his enemy's bannerhands. And they often succeed. The loss of stout sons and daughters is a price that must be paid by the leading family of the clan if it wishes to hold onto its position."
