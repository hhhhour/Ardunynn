	description= _ "A strongarm that has proven themselves in battle will often be rewarded by their chief with a sturdy steed. Others will brave death to steal a mount from a rival clan. In either case, such a battle-scarred warrior is admired for their strength and treated as an authority on clan matters. This esteem is not always exercised wisely. A clever chief will keep their confidence, and an incautious word from them can unite or split families under the chief's leadership."
